    "section": "",
    "text": "Sporting Kansas City has been the MLS topdog since 1996. With many trophies there’s only one way to win; goalkeeping. There have been many historic patterns from wearing pink to being penalty-stop warriors. The longest-tenured coach in the MLS, Peter Vermes has the formula to take goalies and make them household names. One thing Sporting Kansas City does especially well is penalties.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ngoalies &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/Classes Fall '23/SPMC 350/MLSkeepers20182023.csv\")\n\nSKC &lt;- goalies |&gt; \n  filter(Squad == \"Sporting KC\") |&gt; \n  mutate(playerseason=paste(Player,Season)) |&gt;\n  filter(Player != \"Adrian Zendejas\")\n\nLeague&lt;- goalies |&gt; group_by(Squad)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=League, aes(x=Season, y=PKA, group=Squad), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=SKC, aes(x=Season, y=PKA), color=\"#002F65\") + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Penalty attempts allowed\", \n    title=\"Sporting KC faces few Penalties\", \n    subtitle=\"Sporting Kansas City keeps penalty attempts at bay.\", \n    caption=\"Source: FB Reference | Lauren Karlin\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n       plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nPenalties. It’s arguably the most stressful thing a goalie has to go up against. Sporting KC just won the wildcard match with penalties and has continued to rock the playoffs after knocking out the #1 seed St. Louis in the round of 16. Being Penalty stoppers isn’t new to Sporting. In 2013, Sporting most notably won the MLS Championship beating Salt Lake City in Penalties where goalie Jimmy Nielsen secured his name as a sporting legend. Ever since then, Sporting has been a powerhouse at penalties. Since 2018, Sporting has conceded few penalties. Currently, Sporting’s Tim Melia is arguably the best Penalty stopper of all time. In the penalty shootout, the keeper is 7-0 and 2-0 where he he allowed no goals with having allowed no goals in the 2020 Playoffs the first goalie to do so in the MLS Playoffs. If this doesn’t secure the goalkeeper’s dynasty I don’t know what will.\n\n\nCode\ngoalie &lt;- goalies |&gt;\n  group_by(Squad) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n   saves = sum(Stp), \n  Goalsallowed = sum(GA)) \n\nSKCsquadstats &lt;- goalie |&gt; filter(Squad == \"Sporting KC\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_lollipop(\n  data=goalie, \n      aes(y=reorder(Squad, Goalsallowed), x=Goalsallowed),\n  horizontal = TRUE,\n  color=\"grey\"\n  ) + \n  geom_lollipop(\n  data=SKCsquadstats, \n      aes(y=reorder(Squad, Goalsallowed), x=Goalsallowed),\n  horizontal = TRUE,\n  color=\"blue\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\ntitle=\"Goal-line Defense: The Art of Saying No\", \nsubtitle = \"Sporting KC is in the middle of the league with almost 250 goals allowed since 2018.\",\n  caption=\"Source: Football Reference | Lauren Karlin\",\nx=\"Goals allowed\",\ny=\"\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nSporting is in the middle of the pack in goals allowed, there are also top teams who also allow goals. The top Eastern Conference side, FC Cincinnati happens to be right above Sporting allowing more goals. The difference is that Cinnicinati scored goals and didn’t go 10 games without winning. Sporting is just happy to be in the conversation. There were three different goalies this year due to a Tim Melia injury. This proves that the goalie position was not consistent and that led to more goals allowed. When Melia is in the goal Sporting has more shutouts and comfortably knows Melia will protect the goal.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=goalies, aes(x=`PSxG/SoT`, y=GA),color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=SKC, aes(x=`PSxG/SoT`, y=GA),color=\"#002F65\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=SKC, aes(x=`PSxG/SoT`, y=GA, label=playerseason),color=\"#002F65\")+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Post-shot Expected on target Goals \", \n    y=\"Goals Against\", \n    title=\"Melia benefits from a good defense in front of him\", \n    subtitle=\"In 2019 Melia had a lack of a defense and Sporting was last in the league.In other years Peter Vermes, has put\\n a better back line in front of him as his goals are allowed are lower.\", \n    caption=\"Source: FB Ref | Lauren Karlin\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()+ \n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n       plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n) \n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent seasons, poor defending is what Sporting fans have become accustomed to. From giving up easy goals, having lackluster defending and getting red cards, the defense hasn’t looked good since 2019. In 2019, Sporting let go of their career defenders Seth Sinovic and Matt Besler. These two controlled the defense and without them, they crumbled. Ever Since Vermes let Besler and Sinovic go, no one has solidified their spot in the backline. There is constant rotation in the backline which causes Tim Melia and other goalies to struggle. In 2019, arguably the worst season in Sporting history, Tim Melia allowed a career-high 60 goals scored against him. As the backline fails the keeper and goals are scored, Sporting has their playoff hopes crushed.\nFortunately, Sporting has been on a hot streak in the 2023 playoffs after knocking off the #1 seed and moving on to the Conference Semis. When the defense has their act together Tim Melia is going to be consistent in doing his Superman penalty saves. Mangaer Peter Vermes will continue using his formula to produce one of the top goal-stopping sides in the history of the MLS and continue their run in the postseason."
